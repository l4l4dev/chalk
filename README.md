2. Add cards -> Click "Add Task" in a column
3. Checklists -> open a card and add checklist items. The card shows a tiny progress bar
4. Drag & drop cards between columns to move them through your flow.
5. Search from the search view to filter by text/labels/dates.
6. Export/Import from "Settings" to back up or restore.

## Keyboard shortcuts

(More to come)

## Data & privacy

- Where data lives: stored locally in your browser’s IndexedDB (via Yjs)

- Backups: use Export to save a JSON to disk. You can import it later on any machine.

- No network: the app does not send your data anywhere.

**Tip:** If you want automatic off-device backup, point exports to a folder synced by your own service. We don’t ship any cloud integration.

## Troubleshooting

If macOS says “Chalk is damaged and can’t be opened” (unsigned beta):

1) Move **Chalk** to **Applications**.
2) Open Terminal and run:
   `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Chalk.app"`
3) Right-click **Chalk** -> **Open** -> **Open**.
